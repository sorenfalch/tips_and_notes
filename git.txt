### Merge one branch (eg. dev/feature) into another (e.g. master):

# merge master into the development first so that if there are any conflicts,
# they can be resolved in the development branch itself and master remains clean.

# (on branch development)$
> git merge master            # (resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)

> git checkout master
> git merge development       # (there won't be any conflicts now)

### Get SHA of last commit:
