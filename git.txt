### git pull and overwrite local changes (master branch):
> git fetch --all
> git reset --hard origin/master


### Stage deletion of file or directory, but don't remove local file
> git rm --cached -r somedir
> git rm --cached -r somefile.ex

### Force case insensitivity when rebasing:
> git -c core.ignorecase=true rebase miljoeOgFastholdelse


### Merge one branch (eg. dev/feature) into another (e.g. master):

# merge master into the development first so that if there are any conflicts,
# they can be resolved in the development branch itself and master remains clean.

# (on branch development)$
> git merge master            # (resolve any merge conflicts if there are any)

> git checkout master
> git merge development       # (there won't be any conflicts now)

### Get SHA of last commit:
`git log -1 --pretty=%h`
